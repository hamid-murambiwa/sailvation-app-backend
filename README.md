The API will receive POST requests to create Cruises and Reservations and GET requests to view Users, Cruises and Reservations.
The base URL is: https://pacific-lake-89990.herokuapp.com/api/v1/

If you want to view Users you can call this endpoint:

/api/v1/users

To do the same but with cruises call this endpoint:

/api/v1/users/id/cruises

Both endpoints will return a JSON response with the following format:

```
For Users:
{
  "id":1,
  "name":"Karel",
  "email":"karel@karel.com",
  "created_at":"2022-04-05T13:13:11.814Z",
  "updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:13:11.814Z"
}

For Cruises:
{
  "id":1,
  "name":"Titanic",
  "created_at":"2022-04-06T17:37:29.310Z",
  "updated_at":"2022-04-06T17:37:29.310Z",
  "user_id":1,
  "description": "The unsinkable"
}


**If you need further information about the endpoints you can view the documentation navigating to `/api-docs`.
Or you can just click this [link](https://pacific-lake-89990.herokuapp.com/api-docs/index.html)**
